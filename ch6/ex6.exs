# Iâ€™m thinking of a number between 1 and 1000....
# The most efficient way to find the number is to guess halfway between the low and high numbers of the range. 
# If our guess is too big, then the answer lies between the bottom of the range and one less than our guess. 
# If our guess is too small, then the answer lies between one more than our guess and the end of the range.
# Your API will be guess(actual, range), where range is an Elixir range.
# Your output should look similar to this:
#     iex> Chop.guess(273, 1..1000)
#     Is it 500
#     Is it 250
#     Is it 375
#     Is it 312
#     Is it 281
#     Is it 265
#     Is it 273
#     273
